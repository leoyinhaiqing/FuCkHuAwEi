# FuckHuawei
I made a  plot of the hot-point of 251 event of zhihu, per 10 seconds, by spider

I have some prejudice of this IT giant in shenzhen, for its idiomatic measure of controlling consensus in social mediea to deal with the negative news. The 251 event infuriated me so much because it's a pure guilt to a ordinary worker. I don't know why Chinese environment for the programmer is so stink, I just want to express the simple boycott as a Chinese student and a ordinary person.
